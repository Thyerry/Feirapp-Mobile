# Introduction 
I created this project to get good on creating unit tests and to know how to create integrations with CI/CD with automated tests pipelines.

This is work in progress, there are the [backend](https://github.com/Thyerry/Feirapp) and the [frontend](https://github.com/Thyerry/Feirapp-Frontend) of this same application

# Getting Started
## Installation process

First, make sure that you have expo installed on your machine. If you don't, run the command ```npm install -g expo-cli```. Then, open the terminal on the project root folder and run the command ```npm install``` to download all dependencies.

If you want to use your own device to test the application, you need to have the app Expo Go installed. Expo Go is a app that uses your device as debug bridge without needing any configuration, just need to be in the same network.

# Build and Test
Now it's just run ```npx expo``` to run the application scan the QR code on your device to see using the Expo Go.

If you are using Expo Go, to connect with the [backend](https://github.com/Thyerry/Feirapp) via localhost, you need a way to expose the localhost on your machine to your device. One way to do this is using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).

This project will be discontinued soon. I only built this with React Native because it was the fastest way to build an app just to test the [backend](https://github.com/Thyerry/Feirapp). I always had plans to learn Kotlin and Swift, for Android and iOS respectively. So I'm going to create an application for both systems natively. Wish me luck on this.
